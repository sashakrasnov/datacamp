'''
Opening and reading flat files from the web

You have just imported a file from the web, saved it locally and loaded it into a DataFrame. If you just wanted to load a file from the web into a DataFrame without first saving it locally, you can do that easily using pandas. In particular, you can use the function pd.read_csv() with the URL as the first argument and the separator sep as the second argument.

The URL of the file, once again, is

|   https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv

Instructions

*   Assign the URL of the file to the variable url.
*   Read file into a DataFrame df using pd.read_csv(), recalling that the separator in the file is ';'.
*   Print the head of the DataFrame df.
*   Execute the rest of the code to plot histogram of the first feature in the DataFrame df.

# Assign url of file: url
url = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/production/course_1606/datasets/winequality-red.csv'

# Read file into a DataFrame: df
df = pd.read_csv(url, sep=';')

# Print the head of the DataFrame
print(df.head())

# Plot first column of df
pd.DataFrame.hist(df.ix[:, 0:1])

plt.ylabel('count')
plt.show()
