'''
Performing HTTP requests in Python using requests

Now that you've got your head and hands around making HTTP requests using the urllib package, you're going to figure out how to do the same using the higher-level requests library. You'll once again be pinging DataCamp servers for their "http://www.datacamp.com/teach/documentation" page.

Note that unlike in the previous exercises using urllib, you don't have to close the connection when using requests!

Instructions

*   Import the package requests.
*   Assign the URL of interest to the variable url.
*   Package the request to the URL, send the request and catch the response with a single function requests.get(), assigning the response to the variable r.
*   Use the text attribute of the object r to return the HTML of the webpage as a string; store the result in a variable text.
*   Hit submit to print the HTML of the webpage.
