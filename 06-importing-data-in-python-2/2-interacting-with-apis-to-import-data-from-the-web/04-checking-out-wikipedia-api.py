Checking out the Wikipedia API

You're doing so well and having so much fun that we're going to throw one more API at you: the Wikipedia API (documented here). You'll figure out how to find and extract information from the Wikipedia page for Pizza. What gets a bit wild here is that your query will return nested JSONs, that is, JSONs with JSONs, but Python can handle that because it will translate them into dictionaries within dictionaries.

The URL that requests the relevant query from the Wikipedia API is

|   https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza

Instructions
*   Assign the relevant URL to the variable url.
*   Apply the json() method to the response object r and store the resulting dictionary in the variable json_data.
*   The variable pizza_extract holds the HTML of an extract from Wikipedia's Pizza page as a string; use the function print() to print this string to the shell.

# Import package
import requests

# Assign URL to variable: url
url = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php?action=query&prop=extracts&format=json&exintro=&titles=pizza'

# Package the request, send the request and catch the response: r
r = requests.get(url)

# Decode the JSON data into a dictionary: json_data
json_data = r.json()

# Print the Wikipedia page extract
pizza_extract = json_data['query']['pages']['24768']['extract']
print(pizza_extract)
