'''
API Authentication

The package tweepy is great at handling all the Twitter API OAuth Authentication details for you. All you need to do is pass it your authentication credentials. In this interactive exercise, we have created some mock authentication credentials (if you wanted to replicate this at home, you would need to create a Twitter App as Hugo detailed in the video). Your task is to pass these credentials to tweepy's OAuth handler.

Instructions

*   Import the package tweepy.
*   Pass the parameters consumer_key and consumer_secret to the function tweepy.OAuthHandler().
*   Complete the passing of OAuth credentials to the OAuth handler auth by applying to it the method set_access_token(), along with arguments access_token and access_token_secret.
