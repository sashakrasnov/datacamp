'''
Twitter data to DataFrame

Now you have the Twitter data in a list of dictionaries, tweets_data, where each dictionary corresponds to a single tweet. Next, you're going to extract the text and language of each tweet. The text in a tweet, t1, is stored as the value t1['text']; similarly, the language is stored in t1['lang']. Your task is to build a DataFrame in which each row is a tweet and the columns are 'text' and 'lang'.

Instructions

*   Use pd.DataFrame() to construct a DataFrame of tweet texts and languages; to do so, the first argument should be tweets_data, a list of dictionaries. The second argument to pd.DataFrame() is a list of the keys you wish to have as columns. Assign the result of the pd.DataFrame() call to df.
*   Print the head of the DataFrame.

# Build DataFrame of tweet texts and languages
df = pd.DataFrame(tweets_data, columns=['text', 'lang'])

# Print head of DataFrame
print(df.head())
