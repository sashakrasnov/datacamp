A little bit of Twitter text analysis

Now that you have your DataFrame of tweets set up, you're going to do a bit of text analysis to count how many tweets contain the words 'clinton', 'trump', 'sanders' and 'cruz'. In the pre-exercise code, we have defined the following function word_in_text(), which will tell you whether the first argument (a word) occurs within the 2nd argument (a tweet).

|   import re
|
|   def word_in_text(word, text):
|       word = word.lower()
|       text = tweet.lower()
|       match = re.search(word, text)
|
|       if match:
|           return True
|       return False

You're going to iterate over the rows of the DataFrame and calculate how many tweets contain each of our keywords! The list of objects for each candidate has been initialized to 0.

Instructions

*   Within the for loop for index, row in df.iterrows():, the code currently increases the value of clinton by 1 each time a tweet (text row) mentioning 'Clinton' is encountered; complete the code so that the same happens for trump, sanders and cruz.

import re

def word_in_text(word, tweet):
    word = word.lower()
    text = tweet.lower()
    match = re.search(word, tweet)

    if match:
        return True
    return False

# Initialize list to store tweet counts
[clinton, trump, sanders, cruz] = [0, 0, 0, 0]

# Iterate through df, counting the number of tweets in which
# each candidate is mentioned
for index, row in df.iterrows():
    clinton += word_in_text('clinton', row['text'])
    trump += word_in_text('trump', row['text'])
    sanders += word_in_text('sanders', row['text'])
    cruz += word_in_text('cruz', row['text'])
