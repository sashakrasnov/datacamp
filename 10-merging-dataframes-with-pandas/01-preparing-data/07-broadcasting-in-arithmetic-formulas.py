'''
Broadcasting in arithmetic formulas

In this exercise, you'll work with weather data pulled from wunderground.com. The DataFrame weather has been pre-loaded along with pandas as pd. It has 365 rows (observed each day of the year 2013 in Pittsburgh, PA) and 22 columns reflecting different weather measurements each day.

You'll subset a collection of columns related to temperature measurements in degrees Fahrenheit, convert them to degrees Celsius, and relabel the columns of the new DataFrame to reflect the change of units.

Remember, ordinary arithmetic operators (like +, -, *, and /) broadcast scalar values to conforming DataFrames when combining scalars & DataFrames in arithmetic expressions. Broadcasting also works with pandas Series and NumPy arrays.

INSTRUCTIONS

*   Create a new DataFrame temps_f by extracting the columns 'Min TemperatureF', 'Mean TemperatureF', & 'Max TemperatureF' from weather as a new DataFrame temps_f. To do this, pass the relevant columns as a list to weather[].
*   Create a new DataFrame temps_c from temps_f using the formula (temps_f - 32) * 5/9.
*   Rename the columns of temps_c to replace 'F' with 'C' using the .str.replace('F', 'C') method on temps_c.columns.
*   Print the first 5 rows of DataFrame temps_c. This has been done for you, so hit 'Submit Answer' to see the result!

import pandas as pd

weather = pd.read_csv('../datasets/pittsburgh2013.csv')

# ---

# Extract selected columns from weather as new DataFrame: temps_f
temps_f = weather[['Min TemperatureF', 'Mean TemperatureF', 'Max TemperatureF']]

# Convert temps_f to celsius: temps_c
temps_c = (temps_f - 32) * 5/9

# Rename 'F' in column names with 'C': temps_c.columns
temps_c.columns = temps_c.columns.str.replace('F', 'C')

# Print first 5 rows of temps_c
print(temps_c.head())
