In this chapter, you'll learn to write functions with default arguments, so that the user doesn't always need to specify them, and variable-length arguments, so that they can pass to your functions an arbitrary number of arguments. These are both incredibly useful tools! You'll also learn about the essential concept of scope. Enjoy!
