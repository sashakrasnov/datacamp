Generating permutation replicates

As discussed in the video, a permutation replicate is a single value of a statistic computed from a permutation sample. As the draw_bs_reps() function you wrote in chapter 2 is useful for you to generate bootstrap replicates, it is useful to have a similar function, draw_perm_reps(), to generate permutation replicates. You will write this useful function in this exercise.

The function has call signature draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1). Importantly, func must be a function that takes two arrays as arguments. In most circumstances, func will be a function you write yourself.
'''

import numpy as np

def permutation_sample(data1, data2):
    """Generate a permutation sample from two data sets."""

    # Concatenate the data sets: data
    data = np.concatenate((data1, data2))

    # Permute the concatenated array: permuted_data
    permuted_data = np.random.permutation(data)

    # Split the permuted array into two: perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2
    perm_sample_1 = permuted_data[:len(data1)]
    perm_sample_2 = permuted_data[len(data1):]

    return perm_sample_1, perm_sample_2

Instructions

*   Define a function with this signature: draw_perm_reps(data_1, data_2, func, size=1).
    *   Initialize an array to hold the permutation replicates using np.empty().
    *   Write a for loop to:
        *   Compute a permutation sample using your permutation_sample() function
        *   Pass the sample into func to compute the replicate and store the result in your array of replicates.
    *   Return the array of replicates.
