This will be useful since whether you like it or not, databases are ubiquitous and, as a data scientist, you'll need to interact with them constantly. The Python SQL toolkit SQLAlchemy provides an accessible and intuitive way to query, build & write to SQLite, MySQL and Postgresql databases (among many others), all of which you will encounter in the daily life of a data scientist.
