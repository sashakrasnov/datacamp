'''
Baseball player's BMI

The MLB also offers to let you analyze their weight data. Again, both are available as regular Python lists: height_in and weight_lb. height_in is in inches and weight_lb is in pounds.

It's now possible to calculate the BMI of each baseball player. Python code to convert height_in to a numpy array with the correct units is already available in the workspace. Follow the instructions step by step and finish the game!

Instructions

*   Create a numpy array from the weight_lb list with the correct units. Multiply by 0.453592 to go from pounds to kilograms. Store the resulting numpy array as np_weight_kg.
*   Use np_height_m and np_weight_kg to calculate the BMI of each player. Use the following equation:
    BMI = weight(kg)/height(m)^2
*   Save the resulting numpy array as bmi.
*   Print out bmi.

# height_in and weight_lb are available as a regular lists


# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Create array from height_in with correct units: np_height_m
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254

# Create array from weight_lb with correct units: np_weight_kg
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m**2

# Print out bmi
print(bmi)
