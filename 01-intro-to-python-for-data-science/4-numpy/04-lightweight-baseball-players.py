Lightweight baseball players

To subset both regular Python lists and numpy arrays, you can use square brackets:

|   x = [4 , 9 , 6, 3, 1]
|   x[1]
|   import numpy as np
|   y = np.array(x)
|   y[1]

For numpy specifically, you can also use boolean numpy arrays:

|   high = y > 5
|   y[high]

The code that calculates the BMI of all baseball players is already included. Follow the instructions and reveal interesting things from the data!

Instructions

*   Create a boolean numpy array: the element of the array should be True if the corresponding baseball player's BMI is below 21. You can use the < operator for this. Name the array light.
*   Print the array light.
*   Print out a numpy array with the BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21. Use light inside square brackets to do a selection on the bmi array.

# height_in and weight_lb are available as a regular lists

# Import numpy
import numpy as np

# Calculate the BMI: bmi
np_height_m = np.array(height_in) * 0.0254
np_weight_kg = np.array(weight_lb) * 0.453592
bmi = np_weight_kg / np_height_m ** 2

# Create the light array
light = bmi < 21

# Print out light
print(light)

# Print out BMIs of all baseball players whose BMI is below 21
print(bmi[light])
