In the last chapter, you learned about probability distributions of discrete variables. Now it is time to move on to continuous variables, such as those that can take on any fractional value. Many of the principles are the same, but there are some subtleties. At the end of this last chapter of the course, you will be speaking the probabilistic language you need to launch into the inference techniques covered in the sequel to this course.
