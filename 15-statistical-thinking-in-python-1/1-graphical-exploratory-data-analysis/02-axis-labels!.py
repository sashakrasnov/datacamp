Axis labels!

In the last exercise, you made a nice histogram of petal lengths of Iris versicolor, but you didn't label the axes! That's ok; it's not your fault since we didn't ask you to. Now, add axis labels to the plot using plt.xlabel() and plt.ylabel(). Don't forget to add units and assign both statements to _. The packages matplotlib.pyplot and seaborn are already imported with their standard aliases. This will be the case in what follows, unless specified otherwise.
'''

import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('../datasets/iris.csv')

versicolor_petal_length = df[df.species=='versicolor']['petal length (cm)'].values

'''
INSTRUCTIONS

*   Label the axes. Don't forget that you should always include units in your axis labels. Your y-axis label is just 'count'. Your x-axis label is 'petal length (cm)'. The units are essential!
Display the plot constructed in the above steps using plt.show().

# Import plotting modules
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Set default Seaborn style
sns.set()

# Plot histogram of versicolor petal lengths
_ = plt.hist(versicolor_petal_length)

# Label axes
_ = plt.xlabel('petal length (cm)')
_ = plt.ylabel('count')

# Show histogram
plt.show()
