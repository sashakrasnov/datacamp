Which splits should we consider?

As you proceed to quantitatively analyze the zigzag effect in the 1500 m, which splits should you include in our analysis? For reference, the plot of the zigzag effect from the video is shown to the right.

INSTRUCTIONS

Possible Answers:

o   You should include all splits, so as not to neglect useful data. // There are some good reasons to neglect some splits.
o   You should only include even splits (100 m, 200 m, ...) because you can compare swimmers in lanes 1-3 going against the putative current and swimmers in lanes 6-8 going with the putative current. // The same argument could be made for keeping the odd splits. You can use both even and odd!
*   You should include all splits except the first two and the last two. You should neglect the last two because swimmers stop pacing themselves and "kick" for the final stretch. The first two are different because they involve jumping off the starting blocks and more underwater swimming than others. // You want to use splits where the swimmers are swimming as consistently as they can.
