How to display your analysis

In the last three exercises, you generated a plot, computed means/confidence intervals, and did a hypothesis test. If you were to present your results to others, which of the following is the most effective order of emphasis, from greatest-to-least, you should put on the respective results?

INSTRUCTIONS

Possible Answers:

o   plot, hypothesis test, mean/confidence interval // Does the hypothesis make a stronger point than the mean/confidence interval? The latter tells you how big the effect is; the former just tells you that there is one.
*   plot, mean/confidence interval, hypothesis test // Yes! The plot graphically shows all data, and the scale of the effect is evident. The mean and confidence interval quantify how big the effect is. The hypothesis test, by this point, is so obvious it is useless.
o   hypothesis test, mean/confidence interval, plot // Make sure you read the problem statement; the order should go from most effective to least.
o   mean/confidence interval, hypothesis test, plot // The plot shows all of the data and the size of the effect is clear. The hypothesis test essentially just tells you that there is an effect.
