In this final chapter, you'll apply all of the data cleaning techniques you've learned in this course towards tidying a real-world, messy dataset obtained from the Gapminder Foundation. Once you're done, not only will you have a clean and tidy dataset, you'll also be ready to start working on your own data science projects using the power of Python!
