From stock prices to climate data, time series data are found in a wide variety of domains, and being able to effectively work with such data is an increasingly important skill for data scientists. This course will introduce you to time series analysis in Python. After learning about what a time series is, you'll learn about several time series models ranging from autoregressive and moving average models to cointegration models. Along the way, you'll learn how to estimate, forecast, and simulate these models using statistical libraries in Python. You'll see numerous examples of how these models are used, with a particular emphasis on applications in finance.
