This is a high-level tour of the Seaborn plotting library for producing statistical graphics in Python. The tour covers Seaborn tools for computing and visualizing linear regressions as well as tools for visualizing univariate distributions (e.g., strip, swarm, and violin plots) and multivariate distributions (e.g., joint plots, pair plots, and heatmaps). This also includes a discussion of grouping categories in plots.
