Using axis()

Using plt.xlim() and plt.ylim() are useful for setting the axis limits individually. In this exercise, you will see how you can pass a 4-tuple to plt.axis() to set limits for both axes at once. For example, plt.axis((1980,1990,0,75)) would set the extent of the x-axis to the period between 1980 and 1990, and would set the y-axis extent from 0 to 75% degrees award.

Once again, the percentage of women graduates in Computer Science and in the Physical Sciences are held in the variables computer_science and physical_sciences where each value was measured at the corresponding year held in the year variable.

INSTRUCTIONS

*   Use plt.axis() to select the time period between 1990 and 2010 on the x-axis as well as the interval between 0 and 50% awarded on the y-axis.
*   Save the resulting plot as 'axis_limits.png'.
