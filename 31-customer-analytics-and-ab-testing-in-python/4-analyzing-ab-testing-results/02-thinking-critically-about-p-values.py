Thinking critically about p-values

Below are four statements about p-values. It is up to you to identify which one is true. This is important because p-values are an unintuitive concept and being able to reason about them correctly is extremely important in most statistical work.

INSTRUCTIONS

Possible Answers:

o   The p-value is the probability that the null hypothesis is true given the data observed. // False, this is a concept useful in statistics but is not what the p-value is.
o   A large p-value should always be interpreted as evidence in favor of the null hypothesis. // False, this could also be the result of a test with low power.
*   The p-value is the probability of observing a value as or more extreme than the one observed under the Null Hypothesis. // Correct, this is precisely what a p-value represents! Good Work.
o   If the evidence for the Null Hypothesis is strong, then the p-value will be small. // False, this is backwards. The evidence against the Null Hypothesis is represented by this.
