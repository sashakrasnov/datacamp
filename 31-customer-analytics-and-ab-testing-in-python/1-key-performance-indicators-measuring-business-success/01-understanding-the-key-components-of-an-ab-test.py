Understanding the key components of an A/B test

From our discussion so far, which of the following do you think is the key component of an A/B test's usefulness?

Possible Answers:

o   Having exactly the same size test and control group. // While the groups should be similar in size, there is no need for them to be exactly the same size. // Correct! Randomness helps ensure nothing else is impacting our observed results.
*   Having the users be randomly assigned to groups. // Each test will need to be run for a different length of time. There is no general rule guiding this across tests.
o   Running the test for at least three weeks.
o   Having an equal number of males and females in each group. // Ideally we want our groups to be similarly composed, but an identical composition is not needed.
