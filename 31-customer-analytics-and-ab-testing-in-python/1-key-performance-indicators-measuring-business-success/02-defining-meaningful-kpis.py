Defining meaningful KPIs

Identify which of the following would not be a meaningful KPI for a small foodtruck trying to optimize its business.

Possible Answers:

o   Customers served per hour. // This is a solid KPI, it would help you to optimize your efficiency in serving customers.
o   Average profit per meal sold. // This is a great and common metric. Many businesses rely profit per unit sold as a KPI.
o   Revenue lost in food waste per day. // This metric, while somewhat specific to this business, would be helpful in cutting costs in a practical way.
*   Meals sold over the past year. // Correct! For some businesses yearly metrics are useful. But for a food truck trying to optimize its sales this is too long of a period.
