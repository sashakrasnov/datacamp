Queen and spade

In this example, you'll use the generalized probability formula P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B) to calculate the probability of two events. Consider a deck of cards (13 cards x 4 suites = 52 cards in total). One card is drawn at random. What is the probability of getting a queen or a spade? Here event A is the card being a queen and event B is the card being a spade. Think carefully about whether the two events have anything in common.
