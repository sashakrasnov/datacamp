Simulations are a class of computational algorithms that use the relatively simple idea of random sampling to solve increasingly complex problems. Although they have been around for ages, they have gained in popularity recently due to the rise in computational power and have seen applications in multiple domains including Artificial Intelligence, Physics, Computational Biology and Finance just to name a few. Students will use simulations to generate and analyze data over different probability distributions using the important NumPy package. This course will give students hands-on experience with simulations using simple, real-world applications.
