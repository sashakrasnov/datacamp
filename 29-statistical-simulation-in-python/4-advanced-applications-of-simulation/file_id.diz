In this chapter, students will be introduced to some basic and advanced applications of simulation to solve real-world problems. We'll work through a business planning problem, learn about Monte Carlo Integration, Power Analysis with simulation and conclude with a financial portfolio simulation. After completing this chapter, students will be ready to apply simulation to solve everyday problems.
