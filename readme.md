# Data Science course by DataCamp

I've completed this course back in 2018. All exercises in the course are made in such a way that you only need to implement a certain part of the whole algorithm. Thus, the preceding part of the algorithm is often unknown. Typically it concerns data loading and preprocessing. At the time you implement your part of the algorithm, the data is already loaded and prepared. While analyzing your work later, it is quite difficult to understand how the data was loaded and prepared to your part of the algorithm.

In this repository, you will find completed exercises with "restored" algorithms &ndash; with data loading and preprocessing &ndash; just unpack dataset.7z and run.

Anyway, this course is too easy, and I would recommend it only for people who make the first step in Python, data processing, statistical analysis, and visualization.
