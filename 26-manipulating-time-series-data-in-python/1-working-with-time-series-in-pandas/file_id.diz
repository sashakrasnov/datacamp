This chapter lays the foundations to leverage the powerful time series functionality made available by how Pandas represents dates, in particular by the DateTimeIndex. You will learn how to create and manipulate date information and time series, and how to do calculations with time-aware DataFrames to shift your data in time or create period-specific returns.
