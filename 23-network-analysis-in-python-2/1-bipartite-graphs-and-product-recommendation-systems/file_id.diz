In this chapter, you will learn about bipartite graphs and how they are used in recommendation systems. You will explore the GitHub dataset from the previous course, this time analyzing the underlying bipartite graph that was used to create the graph that you used earlier. Finally, you will get a chance to build the basic components of a recommendation system using the GitHub data!
