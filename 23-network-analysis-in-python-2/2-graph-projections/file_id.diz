In this chapter, you will use a famous American Revolution dataset to dive deeper into exploration of bipartite graphs. Here, you will learn how to create the unipartite projection of a bipartite graph, a very useful method for simplifying a complex network for further analysis. Additionally, you will learn how to use matrices to manipulate and analyze graphs - with many computing routines optimized for matrices, you'll be able to analyze many large graphs quickly and efficiently!
